    "## Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains the implementation of a simple multiple agent system using the `llama_index` framework. The implementation includes three agents:\n",
    "1. **DefaultResponseAgent**: Handles general questions (like greetings, general inquires, ...).\n",
    "2. **BasicMathAgent**: Performs basic mathematical operations.\n",
    "3. **RouterAgent**: Root Agent. Its main task is to route tasks to the appropriate agent based on the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates that an agent (here `BasicMathAgent`) can utilize tools when it is initialized as a single agent within the `AgentWorkflow`. However, when the same agent is included in the multi-agent system, it is unable to use the tools and provides random responses instead."
